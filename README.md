# pig-game

This is a simple implementation of the Pig Game using JavaScript and DOM manipulation. The Pig Game is a two-player dice game where the players take turns rolling a single die. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". If the player rolls a 1, they score no points for that turn and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to reach 100 wins.
